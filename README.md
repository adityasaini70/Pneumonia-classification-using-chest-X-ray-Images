# Pneumonia-classification-using-chest-X-ray-Images

Pneumonia is a deadly lung infection which impacts millions of people around the world. According to a report by the American Thoracic
Society in 2015, it was the worldâ€™s leading cause of death among children under 5 years of age.
This project deals with classification of pneumonia based on chest X-ray images using Machine
Learning based techniques. With this project,
we hope to make the diagnostic process easier
by providing quick and accurate results.

# Dataset
For training our models, we used the Labeled Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Chest X-Ray Images for Classification hosted publicly under the Creative Commons License at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2.
